\usage{
plot_ppmc(mcmc, observed_effects, observed_weights, meta, filename,
  discrepancy, simulated_discrepancy)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc}{The data frame containing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo values}

\item{observed_effects}{A vector of observed effect sizes from the
meta-analysis.}

\item{observed_weights}{A vector of observed weights from the
meta-analysis.}

\item{meta}{An 'rma' object that contains the results of a meta-analysis
performed in the metafor package.}

\item{filename}{A character variable that serves as the stem for all saved
`   output files.}

\item{discrepancy}{A vector of observed discrepancies between the obtained
study-level effects.}

\item{simulated_discrepancy}{A vector of the simulated discrepancies of the
simulated study-level effects.}
